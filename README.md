### User Requirements and Expectations:
<p>Shopping online has become a cornerstone to modern life, a user needs to feel safe and comfortable in order for them to continue with a purchase online. Especially when it comes to using a site / service that is not as well known as big companies / webservices. To tackle this and to ensure we can provide the best possible UX, proper authentication and secure payments through Stripe is necessary to offer peace of mind to the consumer.</p>

#### Requirements:
* Interact with a visually appealing and intuative website.
* Navigate the website on multiple devices with ease.
* Consume information about various products / services easily.
* Add products / services to a shopping cart in a safe and secure way.
* View orders in profile dashboard section.
* Ensure contact to the company / owner is easily accessible for the user.

#### Expectations:
* The website will not store payment information from customers orders on the websites database.
* The website will load with sufficient speed
* The website will ensure safe storage of user details.
* The content will be digestible on multiple devices, mobile, tablet, laptop, large screens.
* The website will have good contrast colours to ensure a user can digest the information easily.
* The website will have a navbar to ensure navigation around the site conforms to good UX.

## Design Choices:
<p>From the start the site design is extremely important to ensure a user is interested in the site, they will stay on the site and view what is to be offered and potentially purchase a product. The site will have a minimalistic theme to ensure the user is not distracted by too many colours, and also for colours to compliment the imagery used across the site.</p>

### Fonts: 
<p>I have chosen the # font for this project as the font family for this website made sense as it provided a clean and elegant & clean style to go along nicely with the colour scheme. And also helped to ensure the information on the site was readable to the user.</p>

### Icons:
<p>I have decided to use the collection of icons from font-awesome, as the collection they have are vast and easy to use. They have a wide range of icons that have come in handy for things such as the shopping cart and user icon</p>

### Colours:
<p>The colours I have chosen for this website will compliment the minimalistic feel and tones of the website, having a visually appealing contrast provides a more elegant user experience for those using / navigating the site website, below is a list of colours user across the website.</p>
